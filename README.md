# 🚀 The Polyglot Interpreter Project

> ⚡ A revolutionary **cross-language development environment** that seamlessly executes C, Python, and Java code in a single pipeline with **automatic variable sharing**, **nested language blocks**, and **intelligent cross-language conversion**.

This isn't just another code runner — it's a paradigm shift. What started as a proof-of-concept evolved into an intelligent orchestrator that breaks down language barriers, enabling developers to leverage the best features of each language in a unified workflow.

## ✨ Revolutionary Features

### 🔄 **Sequential Multi-Language Execution**

Write C, Python, and Java code in sequence with **automatic variable sharing** - no manual JSON handling required!

```poly
::c
int nums[] = {50, 25, 75, 100, 10};
float pi = 3.14f;
char name[] = "Polyglot";
::/c

::py
# Variables from C are automatically available!
nums.sort()
pi_doubled = pi * 2
message = f"Hello from {name}! Pi doubled = {pi_doubled}"
::/py

::java
// All variables seamlessly passed to Java
System.out.println("Sorted numbers: " + Arrays.toString(nums));
System.out.println("Message: " + message);
::/java
```

---

### 🎯 **Nested Language Blocks with Cross-Language Conversion**

**World's first** nested language execution: embed Python code inside C loops with **automatic syntax conversion**!

```poly
::c
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
printf("Square calculations:\n");
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("Number %d squared = ", numbers[i]);
    ::py print(numbers[i] * numbers[i]) ::/py
}
::/c
```

✨ Magic happens: The Python `print()` statement automatically converts to C `printf()` calls during execution!

### 🎛️ **Smart Debug Mode Toggle**

Perfect for both development and production use:

* **🔍 Debug ON**: Detailed execution pipeline, variable tracking, state transitions
* **✨ Debug OFF**: Clean output showing only your program results

---

### 🌐 **Professional Web Interface**

* **🖥️ Live code editor** with multi-language syntax highlighting
* **⚡ Real-time WebSocket execution** for instant feedback
* **📁 File upload/download** for `.poly` files
* **📱 Responsive design** that works everywhere
* **🎨 Dark theme** optimized for coding

---

### 🏗️ **Intelligent Variable Management**

* **🔍 Static analysis** detects variable declarations and modifications
* **🔄 Automatic type conversion** between languages (int[], List, int[])
* **📊 Cross-language data structures** (arrays, strings, objects)
* **🎯 Smart variable injection** eliminates manual JSON handling

---

## 🎯 Advanced Examples

### **Complex Data Processing Pipeline**

```poly
::c
int sales_data[] = {150, 200, 175, 300, 250};
char region[] = "North America";
float tax_rate = 0.08f;
::/c

::py
import statistics
total_sales = sum(sales_data)
avg_sales = statistics.mean(sales_data)
tax_amount = total_sales * tax_rate
report = {
    "region": region,
    "total": total_sales,
    "average": round(avg_sales, 2),
    "tax_due": round(tax_amount, 2)
}
::/py

::java
System.out.println("=== SALES ANALYSIS REPORT ===");
System.out.println("Region: " + report.get("region"));
System.out.println("Total Sales: $" + report.get("total"));
System.out.println("Tax Due: $" + report.get("tax_due"));
::/java
```

---

### **Nested Language Loops**

```poly
::c
int matrix[3][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7,8,9}};
printf("Processing matrix:\n");
for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        printf("Element [%d][%d] = ", i, j);
        ::py print(matrix[i][j] ** 2) ::/py
        printf(" ");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
::/c
```
