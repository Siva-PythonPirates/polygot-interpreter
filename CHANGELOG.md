# 📋 CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the Polyglot Interpreter project.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-27 🎉

### 🚀 Revolutionary Nested Execution

#### ✨ Added
- **Simple Nested Block Support**: Cross-language variable sharing within single blocks
- **Automatic Variable Extraction**: C variable declarations (`int a = 5`) automatically parsed
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Python results automatically available in C code
- **Smart Variable Injection**: No manual JSON handling required
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time streaming for both nested execution modes
- **Enhanced Debug Mode**: Complete variable tracking and injection visualization

#### 🎯 Features
- Execute code like: C variables → Python processing → C final output
- Example: `int a=5, b=10` → Python `result = a*b*2` → C `printf("Result: %d", a+b+result)`
- Automatic type conversion and variable injection
- Clean workspace organization with test files in `backend/tests/`

#### 🧪 Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite for simple nested execution
- WebSocket integration tests for frontend compatibility
- Debug mode toggle validation
- 30+ test cases covering all execution scenarios

#### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README with simple nested execution examples
- Added testing section with expected outputs
- Comprehensive feature documentation
- Clean workspace organization guide

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-26 🏗️

### 🎯 SharedStateOrchestrator Architecture

#### ✨ Added
- **Complete OOP Rewrite**: Clean, maintainable SharedStateOrchestrator class
- **Centralized State Management**: Single global state dictionary
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Full Python type hints throughout
- **Modular Design**: Specialized methods for each concern
- **Loop-Based Nested Execution**: Python/Java blocks inside C loops
- **Professional Web Interface**: React frontend with syntax highlighting

#### 🛠️ Technical
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket support
- Docker containerization for secure execution
- Vercel + GitHub Codespaces deployment
- Cross-language variable conversion
- Real-time execution streaming

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

### 🎯 Planned Features
- **Multiple nested levels**: C → Python → Java → Python chains
- **Complex data structures**: Objects, nested arrays, custom types  
- **More languages**: JavaScript, Rust, Go support
- **IDE integration**: VS Code extension
- **Collaborative editing**: Real-time multi-user coding
- **Package management**: Import external libraries across languages
- **Performance optimization**: Faster execution pipeline
- **Advanced debugging**: Breakpoints, step execution

### 🌟 Vision
Building the world's first truly seamless polyglot development environment where language barriers disappear and developers can leverage the best features of any programming language in a unified workflow.
